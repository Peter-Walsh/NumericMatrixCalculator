# NumericMatrixCalculator
This is my matrix processor application. It runs a menu that allows users to perform different operations on matricies.

# Goal
The goal of this project was to prepare myself for an introduction to object-oriented programming course that I signed up for over the summer, and to implement some of the algorthims I'd been studying in my linear algebra course from the previous semester. 

# Functionality
- Taking the inverse of a matrix
- Finding the determinant of a matrix
- Transposing matricies (vertically, horizonally, diagonally)
- Multiplying by scalar quantities
- Multiplying and adding matricies together

# What I learned
- Taking the inverse of matrix
- Finding the determinant of matrix (Square matrix)
- Transposing matricies (vertically, horizonally, diagonally)
- Experience working with 2D arrays/matricies in Java
- Experience with Java programming language

# How to get started
I built the program using Java 11.0.5, but if I had to guess, it should work with any version of Java later than Java 8. Once that's installed, all you have to do to run the program is navigate to the main.java:
```
